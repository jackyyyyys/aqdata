2022-06-08 15:07:09.867465: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:193] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

WARNING:tensorflow:5 out of the last 5 calls to <function Model.make_predict_function.<locals>.predict_function at 0x7fb02c0dadc0> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to 
(1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, 
(2) passing tensors with different shapes, 
(3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. 
For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop.
For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for more details.
